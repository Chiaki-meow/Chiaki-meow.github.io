欢迎来到我的网站！

目前我在交大的软件学院读硕士:D，研究方向是计算机图形学、游戏以及与其中的交互。我本科同样在交大软院的coding中度过！

Currently, I am a master student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring
in Software Engineering. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2023.

My current research is about computer graphics, games, and human computer interaction between them. 

To make a better interactive world!
